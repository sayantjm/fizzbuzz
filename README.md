## Background 
The Aeroplane class already defines a method called "fly" and has an implementation for it.
The Car class already has an implementation for "drive".
   
## The problem  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".

For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Solution
Used the Iterator Design Pattern
